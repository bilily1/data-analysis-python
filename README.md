# Python Data Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview
This project is a **group academic project** carried out as part of the
**Digital Skills & Python Programming** module.

The objective of the project is to analyze a real-world dataset using Python
in order to extract meaningful insights and visualize key trends.
